#JS-Role-Playing-Game
Welcome to Vampire Hunter! This is a JavaScript-based role-playing game where you play as a Vampire Hunter on a mission to defeat Dracula. You'll battle monsters, upgrade your items, lose health, and earn gold and XP to level up. Originally a freeCodeCamp project, it has been customized with a spooky "Halloween" mode for added challenge. The game uses JavaScript for logic, with HTML and CSS for the interface.
